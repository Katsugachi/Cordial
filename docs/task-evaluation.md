# Task mode evaluation

Task mode is experimental and is not yet validated for autonomous complex or
long-running work. The generated live test in `crates/cordial-core/tests/live_model.rs`
creates a small CSV calculation and a two-question Word worksheet at runtime.
A separate Python verifier checks item totals and reads the output Word XML
independently of Cordial's DOCX tools. The test also requires a created,
progressing and completed checklist. It uses a disposable workspace and
approves writes in the test harness; this is not the app's permission policy.

These are smoke tests, not a sufficiently complex, fully unseen, research-based
benchmark. They do not establish correctness for arbitrary worksheets, preserved
Word formatting, long tasks, task recovery after application exit, or hostile
local filesystem races.

In [run 41729131338](https://github.com/Katsugachi/Cordial/actions/runs/41729131338),
the independent verifier accepted both output artifacts, but the live test
failed because neither task completed a checklist: the CSV plan remained
unfinished and the Word task had no plan. Earlier runs also failed checklist
progression. The ordinary Rust, UI, desktop and inference-stack jobs passed in
that run. Do not treat successful arithmetic artifacts as proof that Task mode
completed the requested autonomous workflow.
